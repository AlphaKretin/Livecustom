Basic Card Submission Guidelines:

-Must have a working card script, card database, and pictures. We will not take requests to be scripted for you.

-Cards should have a "+0" effect on card advantage, except with extreme costs or conditions. (Even then, chances are low to be added)

-No "instant win" conditions unless it is creative and balanced.

-Card text must follow PCST standards, as of Series 9 or higher (for example, we accept either "graveyard" or "GY", but it must be consistent.)

-Card pictures must be SFW. Picture resolution must be 177x254 and in JPG format for card proxies, 512x512 in PNG for field images.

-Cards must pass review by Gideon, passing both these guidelines and a general evaluation of balance.

(Rules subject to change.)
