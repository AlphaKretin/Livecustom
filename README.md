Basic Card Submission Guidelines:

-Must have a working card script, card database, and pictures. We will not take requests to be scripted for you.

-Card ID's must start with 515xxxxxxx (10 numbers total, first 3 starting with 515. Few exceptions will be made.)

-Cards should have a "+0" effect on card advantage, except with extreme costs or conditions. (Even then, chances are low to be added)

-No "instant win" conditions unless it is creative and balanced.

-Card text must follow PCST standards, as of Series 9 or higher (for example, we accept either "graveyard" or "GY", but it must be consistent.)

-Card pictures must be SFW. Picture resolution must be 177x254 and in JPG format for card proxies, 512x512 in PNG for field images.

-Cards must pass review by Gideon, passing both these guidelines and a general evaluation of balance.

(Rules subject to change.)

Balance Tips

Ask yourself these questions when designing the card.

Is your card strictly better than something that has seen play in the past few formats?

Is it very similar to something that's currently Limited or Forbidden?

If you were the opponent, would you have a major problem trying to play around or get rid of this card?

Can it cause an OTK, starting from a nearly empty field?

If the answer to any of these questions is "Yes", consider toning down the effect or applying restrictions.
If you're in doubt, just tone it down yourself.
