* if the name don't match, it probaly mean you done Pr in wrong repository.
* if it match (gideon/livecustom), just wait for gideon to review it and give final word.

observations:
* case you branch is not even with the branch you forking, there a small probability that the PR (Pull Request) got some conflict (so it can't be merged), in case you want to be sure to avoid that, you can simply refork, by deleting the current fork on forked reporistory, settings>delet this repository, they fork again (don't doo this if you still have a open PR as it will close it without merging).
* having a PR open don't mean you can't change the changes, just click fork again and back to repository used for PR, and do the additional changes you want.
